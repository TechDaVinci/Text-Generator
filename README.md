# Text_Generator

## Introduction
The Text Generator built at Character level using PyTorch framework and Unicode library is a great example of how Deep Learning can be used to generate new text based on a given corpus. In this project, a Text Generator was built with the aim of generating Baby Names. The project utilized a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) block that takes inputs, applies embedding, and finally puts them through an LSTM layer. The RNN block was then used in the Training method of the Generator block with character by character input.

## Conclusion
The Text Generator built at Character level using PyTorch framework and Unicode library is a valuable contribution to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project demonstrates how Deep Learning techniques can be applied to generate new text based on a given corpus. The ability to generate new baby names can be of great use in various industries. This project utilized a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) block, which is a powerful tool in NLP, to achieve the desired results. Overall, this project highlights the potential of Deep Learning in text generation tasks and offers a glimpse into the promising future of NLP.
